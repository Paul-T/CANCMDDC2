# CANCMDDC2
 
This repository is to hold the version of CANCMDDC which uses the Arduino CBUS library of Duncan Greenwood.

I started work on this in 2019 using as a basis the CANCMDDC code which is in the CANCMDDC-Arduino repository based on MERG-DEV. I have publicised this in the Journal and described it as CANCMDDC2.

I am going to use the name CANCMDDC for the actual code here as that is what it is going to be called in FCU as the original CANCMDDC does not work with CBUS events.

The problem which I have starting this work now is that I already have a lot of versions of the code which I have worked with and shared.

There have been several stages where problems have been located and there are also options which I still want to add. My current aim is to have a main branch which is designed to be usable for others, with other branches which incorporate new options.

One thing to bear in mind is that at the beginning of 2020 I was attempting to make the code as flexible as possible to allow for different hardware options. I was unable to test anything other than my own hardware before the lockdown in March 2020 made meetings impossible.

I think that now I will attempt to cover options in a different way with code branches in GitHub.

## Branches

I am going to bring in the old codes as separate branches.

I will document these in [BRANCHES](BRANCHES.md).
