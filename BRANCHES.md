Documentation of the branches of CANCMDDC2.

This is branch develop

This will have the new changes to support the DC Controller.

This originates from CANCMDDC_V2.9 of 22/01/2021

CANCMDDC_V2a Beta 9
Ideas for using IO Abstraction library for task scheduling.

CANCMDDC Version 4a Beta 1

I have added the code to work as a CBUS module without buttons.

This is a version for my old hardware. This code needs more work to be consistent.

The only other example working is CANTEXT2
I will also use Martin Da Costa's modifications e.g. no defs.h file.
First version put together for testing.
At the moment I have no way to turn off the buzzer if a power alarm happens.
